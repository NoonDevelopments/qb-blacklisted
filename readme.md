A simple blacklist system, I wrote this a while ago for a friend but they didn't use it. I have tweaked it a little bit but here you go

- Stops players from signing on to jobs, Sets them straight back to unemployed.
- Stops players from getting in blacklisted vehicles.
- Added a feature where is `DrivingBan` is set to true / 1 in db, the player cannot drive any vehicle at all, if set to false they only are restricted to whatever is set in the config.lua
- Using default qb-input and menu.

- Will not be maintaining this myself, if you want to do anything with it fork it and do whatever or push a pr.
